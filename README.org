#+title: nix-local-buffer

Execute buffer-local Nix environments.

* Usage
This package provides one interactive function, =nix-local-buffer=.

You will be prompted for a flake (defaults to =nixpkgs=) and a list of packages.

Specifying =nixpkgs= and =nodejs racket= will build =nixpkgs#nodejs= and
=nixpkgs#racket= and make their =/bin= directories available in the buffer
environment.
* Why?
1. I want ad-hoc buffer-local environments that don't use the old "nix-*" commands.
2. I wanted to be able to run =quickrun= ad-hoc without making files.
